**Development of Class XI and XII Student Intelligence Dashboards with Career and Academic Recommendations**

**Project Description:**

This project aims to design individualized dashboards for 257 Class XI and XII students, integrating a detailed analysis of their Multiple Intelligence test scores. Each dashboard will visually display performance across eight intelligence categories (linguistic, logical-mathematical, spatial, musical, bodily-kinesthetic, interpersonal, intrapersonal, and naturalistic) in a format that is easily understandable for parents. In addition to visualizing each student’s strengths, the dashboard will include tailored recommendations for potential academic degrees and career paths based on their relative performance in these intelligence areas. 

This project will help parents, students, and educators make informed decisions about future educational and career options aligned with each student’s unique abilities and preferences.
